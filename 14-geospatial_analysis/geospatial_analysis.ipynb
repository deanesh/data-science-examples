    "#### 🌍 What You’ll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the course, you’ll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handle and explore geographic data in Python\n",
    "* Visualize spatial relationships and maps\n",
    "* Perform spatial joins and distance-based analysis\n",
    "* Work with **shapefiles**, **GeoJSON**, and **geopandas**\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 📘 Course Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Your First Map**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn the basics of **geospatial data formats** and the `GeoDataFrame` from the `geopandas` library.\n",
    "* Visualize your first geographic data using `.plot()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import geopandas as gpd\n",
    "\n",
    "world = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))\n",
    "world.plot()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll also learn how to read **shapefiles**, which are commonly used to represent geographical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every geographic dataset uses a **CRS** to define how coordinates map to Earth.\n",
    "* Learn to convert between projections (e.g., from WGS84 to UTM).\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cities = cities.to_crs(epsg=3395)  # Convert CRS for metric distance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial for **accurate measurement of distances and areas**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Interactive Maps**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **Folium** to create **interactive maps** (zoomable, clickable, colored).\n",
    "* Overlay markers, choropleths, and tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import folium\n",
    "\n",
    "m = folium.Map(location=[45.5236, -122.6750], zoom_start=13)\n",
    "folium.Marker([45.5236, -122.6750], popup='Portland').add_to(m)\n",
    "m\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is great for **dashboards** and web apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Point Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work with **latitude and longitude** as points.\n",
    "* Store them as geometry with `shapely.geometry.Point`.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from shapely.geometry import Point\n",
    "\n",
    "df['geometry'] = df.apply(lambda row: Point(row['longitude'], row['latitude']), axis=1)\n",
    "gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry='geometry')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a critical step in turning tabular data into mappable spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Proximity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find **nearby features** (e.g., nearest road, building, or city).\n",
    "* Measure distances between geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from shapely.ops import nearest_points\n",
    "\n",
    "nearest = nearest_points(polygon1, polygon2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **buffer zones**, **distance filtering**, and **nearest neighbor** to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Which hospitals are within 10 km of each school?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Spatial Joins**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Join datasets based on spatial relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Whether points fall inside polygons\n",
    "  * Whether areas intersect\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gpd.sjoin(points, polygons, how=\"inner\", op=\"within\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like a SQL join but using **spatial logic** instead of column values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Manipulating Shapes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **Shapely** to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Create and modify shapes (points, lines, polygons)\n",
    "  * Calculate area, length, and bounds\n",
    "  * Check for containment or overlaps\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from shapely.geometry import Polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "poly = Polygon([(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)])\n",
    "poly.area  # → 1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
