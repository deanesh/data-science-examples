    "#### ðŸ§  What Is SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language**, and it's used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieve** data from databases\n",
    "* **Filter**, **aggregate**, and **sort** data\n",
    "* Perform **calculations**, **joins**, and **subqueries**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Getting Started with SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand basic SQL structure: `SELECT`, `FROM`\n",
    "* Learn to select specific columns\n",
    "* View results of simple queries\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, population\n",
    "FROM world_population;\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **SELECT, FROM, WHERE**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filter rows using the `WHERE` clause\n",
    "* Use comparison operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `LIKE`, `IN`\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM countries\n",
    "WHERE population > 100000000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Group rows using `GROUP BY`\n",
    "* Aggregate data using `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`\n",
    "* Filter grouped results with `HAVING`\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS country_count\n",
    "FROM countries\n",
    "GROUP BY continent\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **ORDER BY**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sort results using `ORDER BY`\n",
    "* Use `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, population\n",
    "FROM countries\n",
    "ORDER BY population DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **AS and WITH**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `AS` to rename columns or tables (aliasing)\n",
    "* Use `WITH` to write **temporary tables** (Common Table Expressions - CTEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH top_countries AS (\n",
    "    SELECT name, population\n",
    "    FROM countries\n",
    "    ORDER BY population DESC\n",
    "    LIMIT 5\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM top_countries;\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **JOINs and UNIONs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combine data from multiple tables using:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `INNER JOIN`\n",
    "  * `LEFT JOIN`\n",
    "  * `UNION`\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT employees.name, departments.name\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "INNER JOIN departments\n",
    "ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Nested Queries and Subqueries**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **subqueries** inside `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE`\n",
    "* Useful for filtering based on aggregated or derived values\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM countries\n",
    "WHERE population > (\n",
    "    SELECT AVG(population)\n",
    "    FROM countries\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### âœ… Skills You'll Gain\n",
    "\n",
    "* Query and explore large datasets\n",
    "* Perform aggregations and calculate statistics\n",
    "* Join multiple tables\n",
    "* Use subqueries and CTEs for complex queries\n",
