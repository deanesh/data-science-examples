    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Welcome to Computer Vision**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overview of what CV is and why CNNs are used\n",
    "* Introduction to **convolutional layers** and how they detect patterns in images\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ Youâ€™ll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why regular dense layers donâ€™t work well on images\n",
    "* What a **convolution** does in a neural network\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Conv2D** layers\n",
    "* **MaxPooling2D**\n",
    "* How CNNs learn to detect edges, textures, and shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = keras.Sequential([\n",
    "    layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),\n",
    "    layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),\n",
    "    layers.Flatten(),\n",
    "    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n",
    "\n",
    "train_gen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)\n",
    "train_data = train_gen.flow_from_directory('train/', target_size=(150, 150))\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Transfer Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **pre-trained models** like VGG16 or MobileNet\n",
    "* Great for when you have **limited data** but want **high accuracy**\n",
