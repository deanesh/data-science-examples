    "#### ðŸ§  What Is AI Ethics?\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Ethics** is the field concerned with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How AI systems **affect people and society**\n",
    "* How to **prevent harm, discrimination, or misuse**\n",
    "* Ensuring AI is **fair, transparent, and accountable**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ“˜ Course Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The course consists of concise lessons focused on real-world examples and key concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Why Ethics Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "* AI and ML systems increasingly make decisions that impact **real people** (e.g., hiring, loans, healthcare).\n",
    "* These systems can **amplify existing bias** or create **new inequalities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ§  **Key idea**: Just because something is technically accurate doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s fair or ethical.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Fairness and Bias**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the difference between:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Bias in data** (e.g., historical discrimination)\n",
    "  * **Bias in models** (e.g., learned prejudice)\n",
    "* Types of fairness:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Group fairness**: Equal treatment for groups (e.g., gender, race)\n",
    "  * **Individual fairness**: Similar people get similar outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A facial recognition system performs better on white men than Black women due to biased training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Privacy and Surveillance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discusses the ethics of data collection, usage, and surveillance.\n",
    "* Key concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Informed consent**\n",
    "  * **Data minimization**\n",
    "  * **Re-identification risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ§  **Takeaway**: Just because you *can* collect and analyze personal data doesn't mean you *should*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Accountability and Transparency**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who is responsible when AI fails or harms someone?\n",
    "* The importance of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Explainability**: Making model decisions understandable\n",
    "  * **Documentation**: Keeping records of data and modeling decisions\n",
    "  * **Audits**: Regularly testing for bias and fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ Example: A loan approval model must be able to explain **why** it rejected an applicant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Human-Centered AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Design AI systems that **complement** rather than **replace** humans.\n",
    "* Include diverse voices in development and deployment.\n",
    "* Build systems with **human values** at the core.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ§  **Human-centered AI** means respecting human autonomy, rights, and dignity in all stages of design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Case Study: COMPAS**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The COMPAS algorithm was used in US courts to predict recidivism risk.\n",
    "* It was found to be **racially biased**, unfairly labeling Black defendants as high risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ This real-world example illustrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How **black-box models** can go wrong\n",
    "* The need for **transparency and external audits**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… **Skills You'll Gain**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify **ethical risks** in AI/ML projects\n",
    "* Understand core topics: **fairness**, **bias**, **privacy**, and **accountability**\n",
    "* Learn how to **mitigate harm** in model development\n",
    "* Apply a **human-centered approach** to data science\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Would you like:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A checklist of ethical considerations for ML projects?\n",
    "* A summary of key fairness metrics?\n",
    "* Help applying ethical thinking to your own dataset or model?\n"
