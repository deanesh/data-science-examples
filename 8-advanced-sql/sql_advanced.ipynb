    "#### ðŸŽ¯ SQL Advanced\n",
    "To help you write **more sophisticated SQL queries** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handle complex logic\n",
    "* Run efficiently on large datasets\n",
    "* Are easier to **read**, **debug**, and **re-use**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ“˜ Course Breakdown (Lesson by Lesson)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Writing Efficient Queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn how to **optimize query performance**\n",
    "* Avoid unnecessary operations (like using `DISTINCT` or `ORDER BY` too early)\n",
    "* Use **query execution order** to structure logic\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ **Key Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid selecting more columns than needed (`SELECT *` is costly)\n",
    "* Minimize joins and nested queries where possible\n",
    "* Use **LIMIT** to preview results before running big queries\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Analytic Functions (Window Functions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extremely powerful! Lets you perform **aggregations without collapsing rows**.\n",
    "* Examples: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`, `AVG() OVER()`\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, department, salary,\n",
    "       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `PARTITION BY` to restart the window calculation for each group\n",
    "* Great for **rankings**, **running totals**, **comparisons with prior rows**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **WITH Clauses (Common Table Expressions - CTEs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Organize complex SQL into **modular blocks**\n",
    "* Great for **reusability**, **readability**, and **debugging**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH top_posts AS (\n",
    "    SELECT id, title, score\n",
    "    FROM posts\n",
    "    WHERE score > 100\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM top_posts\n",
    "WHERE title LIKE '%python%';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can chain multiple CTEs to break down logic step by step\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Nested SELECTs and Subqueries**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use subqueries in `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE` clauses\n",
    "* Can help compute derived columns or filter based on grouped values\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE salary > (\n",
    "    SELECT AVG(salary)\n",
    "    FROM employees\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Powerful, but can become slow or hard to read â€” **CTEs are often a better alternative**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **ARRAYs and STRUCTs in BigQuery**\n",
    "\n",
    "* BigQuery supports **nested data** (like JSON). Youâ€™ll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How to **flatten** and **unpack** arrays and structs\n",
    "  * Use `UNNEST()` to access array elements\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT repo.name, COUNT(*) as num_contributors\n",
    "FROM `bigquery-public-data.github_repos.contributors` as contrib,\n",
    "     UNNEST(contrib.contributors) as contributor\n",
    "GROUP BY repo.name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is **essential** for working with modern datasets (e.g. from APIs, logs, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Working with Dates and Times**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use SQLâ€™s **date functions** to extract:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Year, month, day, weekday\n",
    "  * Time differences (`TIMESTAMP_DIFF`)\n",
    "  * Date math (`DATE_ADD`, `DATE_SUB`)\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), birthdate, YEAR) AS age\n",
    "FROM people;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perfect for **time series**, **aging analysis**, or **event tracking**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… Skills You'll Gain\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write optimized, modular, and scalable SQL queries\n",
    "* Analyze data using **window functions**\n",
    "* Work with **nested and structured data**\n",
    "* Handle **time-based analysis**\n",
    "* Improve **query performance** on large datasets\n",
    "\n"
